## ‚öíÔ∏è Resume Builder

OpenResume's resume builder allows user to create a modern professional resume easily.

It has 5 Core Features:
| <div style="width:285px">**Feature**</div> | **Description** |
|---|---|
| **1. Real Time UI Update** | The resume PDF is updated in real time as you enter your resume information, so you can easily see the final output. |
| **2. Modern Professional Resume Design** | The resume PDF is a modern professional design that adheres to U.S. best practices and is ATS friendly to top ATS platforms such as Greenhouse and Lever. It automatically formats fonts, sizes, margins, bullet points to ensure consistency and avoid human errors. |
| **3. Privacy Focus** | The app only runs locally on your browser, meaning no sign up is required and no data ever leaves your browser, so it gives you peace of mind on your personal data. (Fun fact: Running only locally means the app still works even if you disconnect the internet.) |
| **4. Import From Existing Resume PDF** | If you already have an existing resume PDF, you have the option to import it directly, so you can update your resume design to a modern professional design in literally a few seconds. |
| **5. Successful Track Record** | OpenResume users have landed interviews and offers from top companies, such as Dropbox, Google, Meta to name a few. It has been proven to work and liken by recruiters and hiring managers. |

## üîç Resume Parser

OpenResume‚Äôs second component is the resume parser. For those who have an existing resume, the resume parser can help test and confirm its ATS readability.
